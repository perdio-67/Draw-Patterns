An Unfiinished application 80% done, the purpose behind it was to get a deeper understanding of the functionalties while challenging myself to finish it within 2 weeks. 

it can have its own set of shapes, colors, patterns and have integration with RFID to insert matching shapes and tags, while then the user can rotate, move, color and play with the blur and opacity of the shape.
to add, the user can also freely draw with a normal and artistic pen for free pattern creation.
eventaully the canvas can be submitted with the full resoultion of 3840x6480 as a PNG.

the software still need optimization in few areas such as the shape pattern metho lacks speed and the saving process doesn't support multithreading.
